<h3>Known issues introduced in 1.2.13</h3>

<ul>
<li>(<a href="https://github.com/crsdc/badgerapp/issues/16">#16</a>) Due to a bug in the stock mail app in iOS 14.6, emails we generate have annoying &lt;BR&gt; tags in them. This is difficult to address at our end. Solution is to upgrade to iOS 15 or use a different mail app. Feedback welcome if you encounter this unfortunate issue.</li>
<li>(<a href="https://github.com/crsdc/badgerapp/issues/24">#24</a>) Still trying to pin down inconsistent text sizes on some android phones (but not others). Please feed back if you see something like <a href="../text-size-issue.jpg">this screenshot</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1.2.7">1.2.7</h2>

<ul>

<li>Help screen added</li>
<li>Intro screen changes to image and text as requested</li>
<li>Some text editing and wording fixes throughout</li>
<li>Rationalised sett interference tree and video/photo screens (mostly behind the scenes, but has laid the groundwork for report-building upgrade in 1.2.8+)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="note">Note on skipped versions</h2>

<p>Some versions appear to be missing above because they were used for purely internal testing. It's usually not worth going through the steps of submitting a new version to Apple and Google for approval and getting all testers to upgrade until significant functionality has been added.</p>

<p>In all these cases, release notes are batched so when you read about what's changed in a version, that refers to the cumulative effect of changes since the last version that was available to download.</p>

<p>Release notes were not logged here before v1.2.7</p>
