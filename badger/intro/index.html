<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Last updated <strong>1 December 2021</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Thank you</strong> for volunteering to test Badger Watch. Here's some guidance on the current state of the app.</p>

<p>After you've read this and had a go with the app itself, have a look at <a href="../testing">what to test</a> and <a href="../feedback">how to provide feedback</a>.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Purpose and context</h2>

<p>The app's central purpose is to guide you through the process of understanding and documenting badger persecution and related forms of wildlife crime, helping you gather relevant evidence and ensuring incidents are brought to the attention of the Badger Trust, and where appropriate to the police and local badger groups.</p>

<p>The main way the app does this is by taking you through a series of information screens and questions. When appropriate, a report is generated based on your answers to these questions, which you can then review and send to the Badger Trust by email.</p>

<h2 id="status">Current status of reports from the app</h2>

<p>Until further notice, anything you do in the app and any report you produce is for testing purposes only. You can therefore safely experiment with hypothetical reports and don't need to worry about anything you do in the app causing someone to believe an actual crime has occurred or that badgers are in danger.</p>

<p><strong>Please don't use the app to report real incidents yet!</strong> If you have real information you would like to bring to the attention of the Badger Trust while the app is in this phase of testing, please use the <a href="https://www.badgertrust.org.uk/report">Reporting Centre</a> on their website.</p>

<p>Similarly, during this phase of testing, screens that suggest you phone 999 have a link to do this, but it should lead to the placeholder phone number 1234567890, so can be safely tested.</p>

<p>We will notify you when this changes and reporting goes live, by email, and by removing the notice in the app that says it's in testing mode.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>By design (<a href="https://github.com/crsdc/badgerapp/issues/18">#18</a>), the app does not send reports directly, but helps you prepare them to be sent by email. This means you will need to have an email app set up on your device.</p>

<p>During the testing period, you'll find some app features will be enabled or disabled at different times depending on the requirements of the app development process. It should be clear in the app where this has been done deliberately, because buttons will be disabled or you'll see a notice telling you a feature is temporarily disabled.</p>

<p>Changes and upgrades to the app are rolled out regularly. Please ensure your device is set to <a href="../install">update its apps automatically</a> so you can get these promptly.</p>

<h3 id="tablets">Tablets</h3>

<p>The app is intended for use on iPhones and Android-based smartphones. It should also work on iPads and Android-based tablets, but has not been designed specifically for these devices. This is because most tablets are used on Wi-Fi and are less likely to be taken out into the field, and we don't anticipate as many users on tablets as on smartphones. The visual appearance of the app may therefore look odd on a large tablet screen, but it should still function.</p>

<p>Although tablet integration is a not a current development priority, if something that works on your phone does not work on your tablet, or if its appearance makes it impossible to use, please feed this back, including via our <a href="https://github.com/crsdc/badgerapp/issues/14">issue tracker (#14)</a>.</p>
