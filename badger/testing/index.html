<h1>Project Badger testing instructions</h1>




explain about no back end and needing to use email

explain about pre-req - need an email set up

try and mess with it, enter gibberish, text where numbers are expected, tap on the buttons etc

look out for anything that looks like it doesn't fit the way things are on android/ios e.g. date picker
especially useful if you have both

don't expect them to look identical e.g. the date picker is different to fit in with the standard design theme for each system

submit reports, they go to my email

steps to reproduce a problem are always helpful

look out for anything counter intuitive or unexpected

red error sreen and crashes you shouldn't see
