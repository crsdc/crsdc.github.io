We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “last updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the app after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.</p>
<p>New releases of the app may make use of features of your device not accessed by the version of the app you currently have installed. These will be notified to you either by a new request for permission when you use or update the app, or in the app’s app store listings, in accordance with the requirements of the app store or operating system provider.</p>

<h2>Collection of your information by Badger Trust</h2>
<p>The app is intended to assist users in the generation of crime and incident reports and other observations and records for submission to Badger Trust. Privacy of data submitted to Badger Trust as part of reports generated by the app is governed by Badger Trust’s policies, specifically the section titled “Reporting Centre Privacy Notice” on Badger Trust’s <a href="https://www.badgertrust.org.uk/report">Reporting Centre page</a>.
<p>Unless and until you manually submit a report to Badger Trust, the app will transmit no data to Badger Trust.</p>

<h2>Collection of your information by the app</h2>
<p>The information we may collect via the app depends on the content and materials you use, and includes:</p>

<h3>Personal data</h3>
<p>This includes personally identifiable information such as your name and email address that you voluntarily give to us when opting into testing of the app. We store this information only for the purpose of contacting you about updates to or issues with the app, and we do not pass it to third parties without your consent.<!-- choosing to participate in various activities related to the Application, such as chat, posting messages in comment sections or in our forums, liking posts, sending feedback, and responding to surveys. If you choose to share data about yourself via your profile, online chat, or other interactive areas of the Application, please be advised that all data you disclose in these areas is public and your data will be accessible to anyone who accesses the Application.--></p>
<p>The app includes no advertising integration features, and your data is not passed to advertisers, nor does the app access any advertising servers using your personal data or any other data. We are not responsible for data about the use of your device that may be passed to advertisers by third parties such as its manufacturer or the app store or operating system provider your device uses.</p>
<p>We do not access or collect any financial information, nor does the app facilitate or collect payments. The app is offered free of charge.</p>
<p>We do not access or collect any information relating to your social media accounts or your use of social media, nor does the app have any social media integration features.</p>
<p>The app includes a preferences feature to save your name, email address and phone number. This is intended for your convenience, so you don’t have to enter these details every time you use the app to make a report. These are stored in your phone’s internal memory and are not backed up or transmitted anywhere, unless and until you manually submit a report to Badger Trust that includes these details.</p>
<!--p><strong>Derivative Data</strong></p>

<h3>Mobile device access</h3>
<p>We may request permission to access certain features of your mobile device. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device’s settings.</p>
<p>Standard and essential permissions such as the permission to store data locally on your mobile device or to display information on its screen are granted by your device’s operating system by default. At present the following specific permissions may be requested during your use of the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>On iOS devices:
    <ul>
    <li></li>
    <li></li>
    </ul></li>
<li>On Android devices:
    <ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>git </li>
    </ul></li>
</ul-->

<h3>Geo-location information</h3>
<p>The app may request permission to access location-based information from your device to provide location-based services. These services are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display of your current location on your device’s screen when you select an option within the app that does this</li>
<li>Use of your location, or a location you select, as data included in an incident report</li>
<!-- W3W, England and Wales check? -->
</ul>
<p>Your location data is never transmitted by the app to us or to anywhere outside of your device, unless and until you submit an incident report that includes location data. Upon doing this, your location data is processed by Badger Trust in accordance with their privacy policy as linked to above.</p>
<p>Locations may be stored in the memory or storage of your device when saved locations and draft reports are generated by your use of the app, either automatically or manually. You can delete these records by selecting the “My Locations” and “My Reports” options within the app and deleting individual reports, drafts or locations. All such records are removed when you uninstall the app.</p>
<p>Conversion of locations between latitude and longitude and OS grid references is performed within the app, without transmission of location data outside your device.</p>
<!-- what3words -->
<p>If you wish to change the app’s permissions to access to your device’s location or other features, you may do so in your device’s settings.</p>

<h3>Information collected during testing</h3>
<p>If you install the app via its public listing in an app store this section does not apply to you.</p>
<h4>Locations gathered through testing</h4>
<p>Dummy reports created using the app for testing purposes rather than to report actual badger-related incidents may include your location. As with any use of the app, this will only be transmitted to us with your knowledge or consent, when you submit an incident report that includes location data. This data will only be used to assist in the development of the app, and will not be passed to any third party without your consent.</p>
<p>Location information that may be sensitive, e.g. which reflects your home location rather than somewhere arbitrarily chosen, will be deleted or redacted from any testing logs retained by the developer, within 90 days of the public release of the app.</p>
<p>If you install the app via a testing platform, certain additional information helpful to developing the app may be collected both by us and by the provider of the testing platform.</p>

<li>Feedback and screenshots you choose to submit via TestFlight</li>
<li>Crash logs if the app malfunctions</li>

<li>Some technical details about your device that may assist in troubleshooting app problems, such as the software version it is running, time zone, mobile network provider, battery level and free storage space</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information to develop and improve the app, and it is not shared with any third party other than the provider of the testing platform.</p>
<p>TestFlight does not provide us with any information related to any other app on your device or anything else about how you use your device.</p>
<p>Further details about TestFlight’s permissions and privacy policy can be viewed within the TestFlight app.</p>
<h4>Google Play</h4>
<p>For the Android version of the app, we only need to provide Google with your email address, and Google does not provide us with further information about whether you have actually installed the app, or any other details about your device.</p>

<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems <span style="color: #8351f9;">[and our mobile applications]</span> include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p-->
