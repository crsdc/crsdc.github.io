<h2 id="why">Why is a badger crime app needed and what is the app designed to do?</h2>

<p>Badgers are a protected species and badger crime was made a UK wildlife crime policing priority over a decade ago. However, the most recent Wildlife and Countryside Link Wildlife Crime Report suggests that badger crime is on the rise, with a 36% increase in reported incidents between 2019 and 2020, the majority of which are incidents involving badger sett interference.</p>

<p>The likelihood of detection, apprehension and prosecution of perpetrators of badger crime remains very low due to a number of factors, among which are a general lack of awareness of the different forms of badger crime, how to report crime to the relevant authorities and how to gather evidence that will be admissible in court. Good quality evidence documented by primary witnesses is key to the success of an investigation, but evidence must be specific to the offence, requiring knowledge of badger ecology and an overwhelming and often confusing body of wildlife legislation.</p>

<p>The Badger Watch app is designed to be an easy-access tool for use in the field. The app contains a scripted flow which prompts the user with a series of questions, depending on what they have observed. In navigating the app, the user is assisted in identifying the type of crime they are dealing with and is given advice on next steps, which may involve making a report to police via 101 or 999 (where appropriate), or involving other relevant authorities, as well as gathering photographic and video evidence where it is safe to do so.</p>

<p>The app provides access to relevant legislation without the need for mobile data signal, helps users understand which types of evidence are relevant to a particular offence, assists users in identifying badger field signs (essential for documenting 'current use' of a badger sett, for example) and enables them to obtain their accurate location via the phone's GPS. Draft reports and locations can be stored on the user's phone and photos and videos taken with the phone can be geotagged to prove when and where they were taken. The app also contains an option to display the user's location for capture via external camera devices being used to document evidence.</p>

<p>Further information about what the app does and doesn't do will be included in your testing instructions email.</p>

<h2 id="involve">What does taking part in testing involve?</h2>

<ul>
<li>You will need an Android smartphone or an iPhone to take part. The app should work on tablets but is not being designed specifically for these devices.</li>
<li>After consenting to take part, you will receive an email with instructions on how to download and install the app and how to test it. We've come up with a series of use case scenarios for you to run through and doing so may take a couple of hours, but scenarios can be done separately as and when you have time.</li>
<li>You can provide feedback by email and there is also an <a href="https://github.com/crsdc/badgerapp/issues">issue tracker</a> for those who are used to filing bug reports in this way, but this is optional.</li>
<li>Because of the Covid-19 pandemic we ask that you comply with any government restrictions that may be in place during the testing phase and prioritise your own and others' safety. You do not require access to the outdoors to test the app but you are free to test it outdoors if you wish to do so.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design">Why have we designed the sett interference decision tree the way we have?</h2>

<p>There are two ways we could have designed the decision tree for sett interference incidents, according to <em>cause</em> (e.g. farming, development, hunt etc.) or <em>type</em> (e.g. blocked sett, dug sett etc.). We have opted for <em>cause</em> so that the decision tree acts as a kind of funnel starting with mutually exclusive categories. This ensures that the user can be given the most appropriate advice through the app and the incident can be appropriately categorised. <em>Type</em> categories, on the other hand, are not as mutually exclusive, so if we had designed our funnel according to <em>type</em> then this would have only widened the options, not narrowed them. This would have also caused confusion for the user because their incident potentially fits into multiple options (i.e. it could be both a blocked sett and a dug sett), and it would not enable us to appropriately categorise incident reports without manual recoding post-submission.</p>

<h2 id="data">How does the app handle data?</h2>

<p>The app outputs an incident report, which is retained locally on the user's phone and can be edited by the user at a later date. We have designed the app so that it doesn't involve any cloud storage or other backend server. Instead, data entered in the app is stored locally on the user's phone and stored reports are only accessible to them.</p>

<p>Users are then asked for consent to share their report with Badger Trust by email from their phone. Badger Trust retains this primary data controlling function in line with its privacy policy regarding the handling of data submitted through the existing <a href="https://www.badgertrust.org.uk/report">Badger Trust web reporting forms</a>.</p>

<p>For a number of reasons, not least the wide spectrum of crime reporting gateways operated by different police forces, there is no 'direct reporting to the police' option in the app. Instead, the app enables the user to generate a crime report which they can subsequently share with the police outside the app, such as via email, phone or web form, depending on the options available in their police force area.</p>

<p>To facilitate app testing, your name and email address will be stored securely in a password-protected Sharepoint folder, which only the UoE Badger Watch team have access to. This personal data will be deleted within 90 days of the public release of the app. During testing, these details will be used to contact you with essential updates and feedback requests.</p>

<p>Any dummy test data you submit through the app will be received by our app developer and later by Badger Trust's Craig Fellowes, and it will be permanently deleted within 90 days of the public release of the app.</p>

<p>If you have any queries about the University's processing of your personal data that cannot be resolved by the Badger Watch team, further information may be obtained from the University's Data Protection Officer.</p>

<p>Certain additional information is also collected by the providers of the testing platforms, namely Apple and/or Google, as applicable. In the case of Google, this is your email address only. For Apple, the following information is held:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name and email address associated with your testing invitation or your account with your operating system provider</li>
<li>Feedback and screenshots you choose to submit via the testing platform TestFlight</li>
<li>Crash logs if the app malfunctions</li>
<li>Usage information, such as time spent in the app at the point where it crashes or you submit feedback</li>
<li>Some technical details about your device that may assist in troubleshooting app problems, such as the software version it is running, time zone, mobile network provider, battery level and free storage space</li>
</ul>

<p>We use this information to develop and improve the app, and it is not shared with any third party other than the provider of the testing platform.</p>

<p>Apple's TestFlight does not provide us with any information related to any other app on your device or anything else about how you use your device.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h2>

<p>Your participation will enable us to ensure the app works as it should and is designed in a way that the user can understand. We hope the app will become a valuable tool for those who want to protect wildlife and that it will improve the quality and subsequent follow-up of crime reports, as well as improving Badger Trust's understanding of crime trends. Your involvement in testing will help ensure the app's success.</p>

<h2 id="withdraw">What will happen if I don't want to carry on with testing?</h2>

<p>Participation is entirely voluntary and you are free to withdraw at any time without having to provide a reason. You can do so by uninstalling the app and emailing us to ask to be removed from the testing team. Any of your personal data will be permanently deleted.</p>
