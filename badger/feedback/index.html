<h1>Feedback</h1>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Last updated <strong>1 December 2021</strong></em></p>

<p>We're grateful for any feedback you can provide, as it all helps us understand what users of the app may expect, and helps ensure problems can be ironed out before the app's public release.<p>

<h2 id="feedback">How to provide feedback</h2>

<p>Bugs, issues and feature requests are listed at our <a href="https://github.com/crsdc/badgerapp/issues">issue tracker on GitHub</a>. A free account (straightforward to set up) is needed to open new issues or comment.

<p>But if you're unsure how to go about posting to the issue tracker or would prefer to just send an email, that's no problem at all. Please send any feedback to the email address you'll have from when you opted into testing.</p>

<p>If it's easier for you to send screenshots via a messaging app (e.g. Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp) rather than attaching them to an email, just ask and a phone number can be provided.</p>

<p>If you don't post to the <a href="https://github.com/crsdc/badgerapp/issues">issue tracker</a>, it's still worth checking to see if what you've noticed has already been raised there. However, the issue tracker isn't a list of every single development task or feature being worked on, as this would run to many hundreds of items and is not necessary when a single developer is working on the code. If something is listed at the tracker, it's generally because it's been raised in feedback or discussion.</p>

<p>In general for all bugs, the more reliably a developer can reproduce the problem on their own device the easier it is to find and fix the problem. This is why it's helpful to provide as much information you can about the steps that led up to an error or instance of unexpected behaviour.</p>

<h2 id="notneeded">Feedback you don't need to send</h2>

<p>If something in the app is marked as "temporarily disabled" or similar, such as when you press a button and a banner with these words is displayed, that means a feature is being worked on and we're well aware of it. A bug report isn't needed in that simple case, but might be if something is disabled that you believe shouldn't be, or if something needs discussing about the feature that's due to be implemented.</p>

<p>You're welcome to send in suggestions for future development, but due to constraints of time, budget and other factors, there are several features we know would be desirable but are unable to include in the first public release of the app. In particular, for the foreseeable future the app won't allow you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>(<a href="https://github.com/crsdc/badgerapp/issues/18">#18</a>) Submit incident reports except by generating an email</li>
<li>(<a href="https://github.com/crsdc/badgerapp/issues/20">#20</a>) Report general (i.e. undisturbed) sett locations, though you'll be able to use the app to log these for your own purposes</li>
<li>(<a href="https://github.com/crsdc/badgerapp/issues/21">#21</a>) Report badgers killed by traffic, though you'll be able to use the app to log locations of these for your own purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>Rest assured we'll revisit these in the future if the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>If you provide feedback that includes screenshots, personal details might be included, such as if you send a screenshot where your location is displayed. This will be kept confidential.
