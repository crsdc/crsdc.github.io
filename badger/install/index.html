<h1>How to install and update <a href="../">Badger Watch</a></h1>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Last updated <strong>1 December 2021</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Thank you</strong> for volunteering to test Badger Watch.</p>

<p>In this phase of testing, the app isn't available to the public, so it can't be found by searching in the Play Store (Android) or App Store (iOS). For you to be able to test it, we need the email address associated with your Google account (Android) or Apple ID (iOS) so we can invite you. This will be kept confidential in accordance with our <a href="../privacy">privacy policy</a>.</p>

<p>If you've been sent here by someone other than the app team, the app is not in open beta yet, i.e. it's not yet available for anyone to test outside of invited contacts. However, you could ask whoever told you about the app to put you in touch with us, since we're grateful for your interest and would appreciate feedback from potential users as we develop the app.</p>

<h2 id="install">How to install</h2>

<p>These days, nearly every smartphone runs one of two systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iOS</strong> &mdash; all iPhones, iPads and similar devices from <strong>Apple</strong></li>
<li><strong>Android</strong> &mdash; overseen by <strong>Google</strong> and found on devices from just about every other manufacturer: Samsung, Huawei, LG, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the UK, the market is divided about 50&ndash;50 between these two systems, so Badger Watch is being developed to run on both, but instructions for installing and updating differ. Once you've been added to the list of testers follow the below:</p>

<h3 id="installandroid">Android</h3>

<p>On your phone, go to <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.projectbadger.badger">https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.projectbadger.badger</a>. If you're signed in with your Google account, you should see a notice about joining the testing programme. Follow the instructions there, including the link to the app's Play Store listing at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.projectbadger.badger">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.projectbadger.badger</a>. From there you should be able to install it.</p>

<p>If you're not logged in with the Google account you told us about, it'll say the page or app was not found, since it is not yet publicly listed.</p>

<p>Please ensure your phone is set to update its apps automatically, so you can stay with the latest version:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the Play Store app</li>
<li>Tap your user icon: a profile picture or letter in a circle in the top right of your screen</li>
<li>Tap "settings" in the menu</li>
<li>Tap "network preferences" in the menu on the settings screen</li>
<li>Tap "auto-update apps" and ensure it's set to "Wi-Fi only" or "any network" according to your preference, just not "don't auto-update apps"!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installios">iOS</h3>

<p>You'll need to install an app called TestFlight, which is Apple's platform for testing apps not yet publicly listed in its App Store. You can find this by searching in the App Store on your iPhone, or by going to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/testflight/id899247664">https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/testflight/id899247664</a>

<p>When you've installed and opened TestFlight, it will ask for permission to send you notifications. There are unlikely to be many of these but please allow for now. You should then see a "Welcome to TestFlight" screen with some brief general information. From there you can tap "continue" to be taken to what for now may be an empty list of apps, where Badger Watch will later appear.</p>

<p>When you get an email saying you've been invited to test Badger Watch, there will be a button in the email you can tap to take you into TestFlight and install it, after which it will appear in the TestFlight menu, and will be listed with the other apps on your phone.</p>

<p>Please ensure your phone is set to update its apps automatically, so you can stay with the latest version:</p>

<ul>
<li>In TestFlight, tap the 'person in a circle' icon at the top right</li>
<li>Tap "automatic updates" and ensure it's set to "on"</li>
<li>Back on the main TestFlight screen tap Badger Watch in the list and on its screen ensure "automatic updates" is switched on</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="update">How to update manually</h2>

<p>At the current pace of development, new versions are released to testers every few days, so it's important to be using the most recent version available. You can check your version against the notice on the <a href="../">main menu</a>. You might have a more recent version than is listed there, if it's become available before there's been a chance to update this site, but you shouldn't have an older one.</p>

<p>Because we're at the mercy of the opaque approvals processes run by Google and Apple, there's a delay of uncertain length between a new version being uploaded and when it's available to download on your phone. This was several days for early versions but seems to be coming down to a few hours more recently. You may find your phone updates the app overnight.</p>

<p>Sometimes the latest version available for Android and iOS may be out of sync for a day or two, but version numbers run in parallel on the two systems and should always correspond to the same intended functionality. If something works on one system but not the other, they're on the same version number, and this isn't listed as a <a href="../releasenotes/">known issue</a>, please <a href="../feedback/">report a bug</a>!</p>

<h3 id="updateandroid">Android</h3>

<p>Your phone is most likely to do its automatic updates when it's connected to Wi-Fi and is plugged in for a while to charge.</p>

<p>If your phone hasn't updated the app automatically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the Play Store app</li>
<li>Tap your user icon: a profile picture or letter in a circle in the top right of your screen</li>
<li>Tap "manage apps and device" in the menu</li>
<li>If there's a section titled "all apps up to date" tap it and then tap the button "check for updates". If instead there's a section titled "updates available" tap "see details"</li>
<li>If Badger Watch is in the list, just tap "update", or tap on the app's icon or name to show a whole screen about it</li>
</ul>

<p>On the screen about Badger Watch, however you've reached it, you can tap "what's new" or "about this app", scroll down and you should see a version number. This is the latest version available to you. If you know that a newer version has been released, you may just have to wait a few hours for it to show up on your device. Ensure your phone is on Wi-Fi and well charged, and that you don't have a problem such as full storage preventing your phone from installing updates.</p>

<h3 id="updateios">iOS</h3>

<p>Your phone is most likely to do its automatic updates when it's connected to Wi-Fi and is plugged in to charge.</p>

<p>If your phone hasn't updated the app automatically:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the TestFlight app</li>
<li>Badger Watch should be listed along with its version number, and a button to "install", "update" or "open", so tap "update" if you see that.</li>
</ul>
