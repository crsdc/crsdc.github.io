<h1>Listed Buildings app: privacy policy</h1>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Policy last updated <strong>18 September 2025</strong></em></p>

<p>Badger Dynamics Ltd (“we”, “us”, “our”) respects the privacy of our users (“user”, “users”, “you”, “your”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and safeguard your information when you install or use our mobile application (the “app”) on your smartphone or other device such as a tablet (your “device”). If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the app, and remove it from your device. The app is intended for users in the UK.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party online store, mobile store, app store or software distribution platform from which you install the app (an “app store”), which may also collect and use data about you. We are not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.</p>

<h2>Collection of your information</h2>

<p>The app does not collect any information on users.</p>

<p>Except for those opted into testing on specific lists, we do not receive or hold any personal data such as your name or email address when you install or use the app. The app does not operate a system of user accounts, nor does it identify installations of the app to a backend server, since we do not operate such a server nor commission anyone else to do so on our behalf.</p>

<p>The app includes no advertising integration features, and your data is not passed to advertisers, nor does the app access any advertising servers using your personal data or any other data. We are not responsible for data about the use of your device that may be passed to advertisers by third parties such as its manufacturer or the app store or operating system provider your device uses.</p>

<p>We do not access or collect any financial information, nor does the app facilitate or collect payments. The app is offered free of charge.</p>

<p>We do not access or collect any information relating to your social media accounts or your use of social media, nor does the app have any social media integration features.</p>

<h3>Geo-location information</h3>

<p>The app may request permission to access location-based information from your device to provide location-based services. These services are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display of your current location on your device’s screen when you select an option within the app that includes this feature</li>
</ul>
<p>Your location data is not transmitted by the app to us or to anywhere outside of your device.</p>

<p>If you wish to change the app’s permissions to access to your device’s location or other features, you may do so in your device’s settings.</p>

<h2>Options regarding your information</h2>

<h3>Account information</h3>
<p>The app has no features that require the creation or use of an account, other than any account you hold with your app store provider that allows the app to be installed, such as a Google account or Apple ID.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the “last updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the app after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.</p>
<p>New releases of the app may make use of features of your device not accessed by the version of the app you currently have installed. These will be notified to you either by a new request for permission when you use or update the app, or in the app’s app store listings, in accordance with the requirements of the app store or operating system provider.</p>

<h3>Contact us</h3>
